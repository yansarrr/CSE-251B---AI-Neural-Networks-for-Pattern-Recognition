# PA3 - Character level LSTM/RNN for Shakespearean Text Generation

## Please refer the PA3 pdf for instructions!

### You are free to create new functions, change existing function signatures, add/remove member variables/functions, change returns of a function in the provided start code but you need to maintain the overall given structure of the code.

### We have marked sections to be implemented by you as TODO for your convenience

### The RNN and LSTM is runned using the main.py file. Before running, design new yaml file with the hyperparameters in the configs. To run the model, type 'python main.py {configs/yaml file name}' in the terminal.
